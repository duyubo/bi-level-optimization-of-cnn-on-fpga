# Bi-level Optimization of cnn on fpga

* Hardware details: The experiment is conducted without deploying on the FPGA board, thus any device with CPU or GPU and jupyter notebook can reproduce my experiment. Google Colab which is free and pre-installing all dependencies is highly recommended for reproducing the experiment. 
* Software dependencies: 
Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.6+ and pip3
Pytorch + cuda11
* Installation: 
  pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio 
* Experiment workflow:
  Sequentially click "run" button of each cell in the Jupyter Notebook File "EA\_Explore" will reproduce my experiment.
* Evaluation and expected results: This step is expected to have similar plots as the experiment results of combined exploration.
